specfit
----------------
``specfit`` is a group of modules that are currently in development. It provides various tools for creating and analyzing model spectra, as well as quite a few associated utilities. I originally wrote it for my own use, so there's quite a bit of it that could be cleaned up pretty substantially, and that's ongoing. For questions feel free to contact me.


Features
--------
``model_fit_tools_v2.py`` is the workhorse piece of code. It has various implementations of an MCMC spectral fitting routine, as well as a lot of utility functions to support that.

``IMF.py`` is a population synthesis tool. It has several particular requirements that are explained on the :ref:`IMF` page.


Installation
------------

Install specfit by downloading the source code on github.
