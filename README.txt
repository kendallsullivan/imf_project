These scripts together provide the tools to simulate and analyze populations of young stars with varying multiplicity statistics, ages, and extinctions, with more functionalities to come. model_fit_tools_v2.py provides a baseline set of reference functions, plus some framework for another project. IMF.py contains the remainder of the population synthesis code. Each function is documented, but no full documentation for the technique exists as of 27 July 2020. 

Requires a set of model spectra labeled "SPECTRA" containing a wavelength array fits file and associated model spectra from the website associated with Husser et al (2013), which are NextGen models. The population synthesis code only currently supports model spectra with a log(g) of 4.
